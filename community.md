## Reporting bugs

Bugs should be reported through GitHub Issues. When you find a bug, report it
to the repository of the relevant component at the [bblfsh organization](https://github.com/bblfsh/).
If in doubt, report the bug in the [sdk repo](https://github.com/bblfsh/sdk)
with as much information as you have
(including the languages of the code you're parsing),
we can move it to whatever repo is more appropiate after reviewing it.

## Feature requests

If you want to request a new feature, feel free to open it as an issue at the
relevant GitHub repository.
