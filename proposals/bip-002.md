## Abstract

This BIP proposed two new official `Incomplete` and `Unannotated` roles would mark
if the node has been annotated in any way and the quality of the current
annotation.

## Rationale

At the current stage of the Babelfish project, we strive for genericity in the list
of UAST roles and not adding very language-specific features into it until we can
have a wider view about how to integrate or compose these roles for covering as
much ground as possible. 

This is a worthy objective but has the problem of leaving the nodes related with
these features unannotated or with annotations that don't fully express all
the semantic information that the language source code or the native AST have.

This BIP proposes a mechanism to mark nodes with two possible completion status
roles. This will make the UAST user have a wider view of the completeness of the
information provided by it on specific nodes and also could enable new uses cases
(whose specific definition is outside of the scope of this BIP) like helping debug
drivers and provide a completeness summary, with the added benefit of providing a
numerically observable measure of the completeness of every developed driver.

## Example

If a version of the UAST specification didn't have a role that could be matched
for a "coroutine" type function supported by some language, the UAST could still
mark those nodes as "FunctionDef", but without additional information, this would
be providing incomplete and even misleading information to UAST users that could
treat coroutines differently (for example when making stack call deep analysis).

With this BIP implemented, the driver's programmer can add the role `Incomplete`
to these coroutine nodes and the UAST user for that language could then look at
the native AST properties to complete their semantic understanding of the node.

## Specification

### UAST Roles

This change will add two new roles the UAST definition:

- `Incomplete`: For nodes that have been annotated annotations doesn't express the
  full semantic meaning.

- `Unannotated`: For nodes that have received no other annotations.

After this proposal have been fully implemented it'll be implicitly understood
that nodes that have roles set and no `Incomplete` role are expressing full
semantic information.

### Driver and SDK annotation

The Incomplete roles will be set explicitly by the driver's programmer using the
normal process in he driver's `annotation.go` file.

The Unannotated role will be added automatically by the SDK to nodes that didn't
get any other role.


## Impact

- The new roles would have to be added to the SDK's `uast.go` file and the drivers
  rebuild against it.

- The `Incomplete` mark would have to be added by the driver developers when
  defining the rules in the `annotation.go` file. Existing drivers will need to be
  updated.

- The SDK annotation process will implement the automatic would have to implement
  setting the `Unannotated` marks. This will be implemented in the
  `protocol/native/objecttonoder.go` file.

- We'll add a new process to the build system that will check both the
  `driver/normalizer/??ast/??ast.go` file with the static list of nodes for
  existing but unannotated nodes and the integration test results and output a
  summary of incomplete an unannotated nodes.

- The documentation for the driver developer would have to be updated to include 
  the purpose and mechanics of these new property/s or role/s. This is in the file 
  `driver/annotations.md`.

- This BIP will be added to the official documentation in the `proposals`
  section.
