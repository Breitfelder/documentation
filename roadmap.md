# Roadmap

We are still defining a detailed roadmap! But our short term plans are:

1. Evolve UAST specification until a point where we can use it to do some relevant
  analysis.
2. Have Python and Java drivers fully implemented.
3. Create a client library to work with Babelfish Protocol and UAST (_bblfsh/lib_)
4. Create client library bindings for Go, Java and Python.
3. Write drivers for top N languages.
4. Write drivers for a few languages of different paradigms that help us to improve
   UAST definition.
