# UAST Query Language

The clients support querying over the returned UAST to filter for specific
nodes using a client-specific `filter()` method.

The querying uses [xpath syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/) and it can be
really useful to extract features from the code and thanks to the annotation
system implemented by babelfish, it can be done in an universal fashion.

Any of the [node](https://godoc.org/github.com/bblfsh/sdk/uast#Node) fields can
be used for querying, which are mapped in the following way, for example:

- All the numeric literals in Python: `//NumLiteral`
- All the numeric literals in ANY language: `//*[@roleNumber and @roleLiteral]`
- All the integer literals in Python: `//*[@NumType='int']`
- All the elements in the tree that have either start or end offsets: `//*[@startOffset or @endOffset]`
- All the simple identifiers: `//*[@roleIdentifier and not(@roleQualified)]`
- All the simple identifiers that don't have any positioning: `//*[@roleIdentifier and not(@roleQualified) and not(@startOffset) and not(@endOffset)]`
- All the arguments in function calls: `//*[@roleCall and @roleArgument]`
- All the numeric literals in binary arithmetic operators: `//*[@roleBinary and @roleOperator and @roleArithmetic]//*[@roleNumber and @roleLiteral]`
